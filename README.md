Reflection:

The projects for this course revolved around a computer science department at a school called "ABCU". The first project wanted us to create pseudocode for a menu display, design pseudocode that could print the course lists in an alphanumeric order, and evaluate the runtime of the three data strucutures: vector, hash table, and tree data structures. We then ended the project by explaining the advantages and disadvantages that would come from using each data structure.

The second project consisted of us actually creating the code for the pseudocode we wrote in the previous project, and using the data structure we recommended. My code uses a vector data structure to sort the classes. I found that even though it may be slower than other structures, it would have the best outcome with sorting. My approach was fairly simple, as I started by studying the previous assignment that we used a vector data structure and further explored outside sources such as stack overflow. 

When I had trouble with anything, I immediately took a step back and took a small break to just compile everything I had written. After the break, I found that it was easier to look at the bigger picture of the problem rather than the small stuff I would be stressing over. As mentioned above, I also used stack overflow for sources and help when I found myself stuck on parts I did not understand. 

I found some advantages and disadvantages I didn't realize I had before this course. I feel that I understand vector data structures better than I did before, and am more confident in C++ overall after working in it again. I think that developing programs still seems like a big step to me, but I can start to see how they are formed and come together. 

Working on this project provided lots of information on how comments can become helpful when working on large-scale projects. I found myself making notes and "Fix-Me" notificatons so I wouldn't lose my spot when finishing for the night. It definitely is important to keep everything neat and readable so when you or someone else might come to the project the next day, they can easily find what to do and where everything is.
